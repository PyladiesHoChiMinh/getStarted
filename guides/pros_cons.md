Honestly, the only pro for any tool is its job prospect. There are a lot of languages that is more advanced than Python (Haskell, Rust, Julia, etc.) but they haven't yet produced new features/tools that can open their own (big) job markets, which makes learning them, although fun, isn't very useful.

For Python, it is in its prime, which means learning it is not too late yet. Overall, a popular language. It does not always dominate the market, but Python experience is definitely valuable in these areas: AI, data science, data engineering, backend, API, DevOps.

Python pros:
- General-purpose, a lot of good tools in many areas => easiest for a web dev to switch to data science and vice versa
- Libraries integrate smoothly, syntax feels natural, good for mental health
- Tensorflow for industrial AI jobs
- Pytorch for AI prototyping/researching jobs
- Django/Flask and Django REST/python-eve/apistar for web/API development jobs
- Odoo for e-commerce, CRM, ERP development jobs
- Scrapy for web crawling jobs

Python cons:
- Not suitable for high performance computing (those are for C, C++, Rust, Julia)

(*) As for the technical comparison between languages, you can find them anywhere, and they're fun to read, but not really useful, unless you're planning to develop your own language/library.
