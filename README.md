Python is one of the most used programming languages in A.I., data science, and backend development.

[Pros & cons](guides/pros_cons.md)

# Installation

## Windows

It is recommended to install Anaconda instead of the official Python for Windows, because it is more stable.

Download the Anaconda version for Python 3.x [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).

Install as you would with any other program. Official guide is [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows).

## Linux

Ubuntu comes with both Python 3 & 2 installed, so you don't have to do anything.

## Mac OS

Install from the official Python package [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).
